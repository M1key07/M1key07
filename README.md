- 👋 Hi, I’m @M1key07, an ace furry weirdo on the internet :3
(congratulations if you're still reading this, that was an attempt to scare off people I'd rather not interact with)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously), reading (books like the Lord of the Rings, the Last Dragon Chronicles, Eragon, etc), gaming (pc (an hp prebuilt with an rx 6500 xt), various nintendo handheld consoles, and the occasional platformer on my phone); I'm curious about computer hardware as well (as in I want to build a pc (right to repair!) and maybe even a home server/nas)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well I'm in CSP right now, and also Digital Electronics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small python (and simple bash?) scripts for now (maybe)
- 📫 How to reach me: m1key_07 on discord, michaelteeple07@outlook.com, m1key_07 on matrix, M1key_07 on gbatemp, etc (if you see a similar username elsewhere feel free to ask, it very well could be me)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/any (I really don't mind if someone misgenders me, don't bother correcting them, if I want to I will)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... (im adding a quote and/or joke here soon™)
