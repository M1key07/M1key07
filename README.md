- 👋 Hi, I’m @M1key07 (might ask someone to describe me so I can put something here someday)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously), reading (books like the Lord of the Rings, the Last Dragon Chronicles, Eragon, etc), gaming (pc (an hp prebuilt with an rx 6500 xt, very janky, I know :| ), various nintendo handheld consoles, and the occasional platformer on my phone); I'm curious about computer hardware as well (as in I want to build a pc (right to repair!) and maybe even a home server/nas)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... well I'm going into CSA this fall, and also Cybersecurity, I plan on learning html/css and maybe javascript over summer break
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small python (and simple bash/powershell?) scripts for now (maybe)
- 📫 How to reach me: m1key_07 on discord, michaelteeple07@outlook.com, @m1key_07:matrix.org on matrix (i plan on setting up my own server at dome point), M1key_07 on gbatemp, etc (if you see a similar username elsewhere feel free to ask, it very well could be me)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/any (I really don't mind if someone misgenders me, don't bother correcting them, if I want to I will)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... (im adding a quote and/or joke here soon™)
